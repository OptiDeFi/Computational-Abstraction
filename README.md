# **Computational-Abstraction: Mathematical Framework for Local/Global Computation in Intelligence**

## 🚀 **Introduction**

The current paradigm of computation—both in human cognition and artificial intelligence—relies heavily on **sequential processing and brute-force computation**. However, an alternative approach may exist: **nonlinear, abstraction-driven computation**, where intelligence emerges through dynamic interactions between **local and global structures**.

This repository explores the **mathematical foundations of computational abstraction**, investigating how **local computations (granular processing) interact with global structures (holistic understanding) to optimize intelligence efficiency**. By analyzing **nonlinear systems, attractor dynamics, and hierarchical processing**, we aim to develop a framework that **moves beyond classical computation models**.

## 🧠 **Key Hypothesis**

1️⃣ **Current computation models rely on brute-force execution**  
   - Traditional AI and machine learning models depend on **massive data processing**, often requiring **exponential resource scaling**.  
   - Human cognition, however, operates with **far greater efficiency**, suggesting the existence of **higher-order computational mechanisms** that remain underexplored.

2️⃣ **Intelligence operates on local-global computational interplay**  
   - Instead of strict sequential execution, the brain appears to use **dynamic attractors, context-aware processing, and hierarchical structuring**.  
   - **Local computations handle detailed processing**, while **global structures provide contextual coherence**.
   - This allows for **efficient abstraction**, reducing **computational redundancy**.

3️⃣ **Developing a mathematical framework for computational abstraction**  
   - If we can formalize how **local/global interactions** drive intelligence, we may uncover new **efficient AI architectures**.  
   - This could lead to a **more advanced computational model**, requiring less brute-force processing while improving abstraction capabilities.

## 🔬 **Research Goals**

- **Mathematically model** how **local computations interact with global cognitive structures**.
- **Analyze efficiency trade-offs** in **human cognition vs. machine learning models**.
- **Develop prototype AI systems** using **nonlinear hierarchical computation**.
- **Explore potential applications** in **language processing, AI decision-making, and problem-solving architectures**.
